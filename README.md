# NSBudapest Meetup

## [@nsbudapest](https://twitter.com/nsbudapest)

Welcome to our meetup's GitHub page. If you'd like to attend to the next event, RSVP on our [meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/NSBudapest/).

----------
## NSBudapest is..

..a group for people interested in iOS and Mac development. We :heart: quality code, testing, automation, craft beer and mad science in general. :rocket::rocket::rocket:

### What is a meetup?

A place where you can find out how others do the technology. A place for getting to know each other. We are actually a community! :blush:

### How does an event look like?

Talks are 20-30 minutes long, two at a time, one break between them.

Just create an issue in this repository with describing the topic you would like to cover during your talk. Comments are welcome from everyone!

## Code of Conduct

We stand for a Welcoming Community. At our meetups we encourage respectful smart conversations that help improvement and inspire innovation. Sexism, racism, and being an asshole in general is not appreciated. If you do so, get prepared to be challenged by meetup members, who will probably ask what's wrong with you.

## Jobs board

Since [March](https://github.com/NSBudapest/NSBudapestMeetup/blob/master/presentations/March/jobs.pdf), we have a jobs board every month, based on the example of the [NSLondon meetup](http://www.meetup.com/NSLondon/).

**You can add iOS, or Mac development jobs to the board, or yourself as someone looking for iOS, or Mac development related opportunities.**

*We're going to upload the board every month as a pdf to this repository under the given month along with the presentations, and send the link of the board to the event on meetup.com.*

### How does it look like?

There's a doc, that you can edit on the spot, at our meetup. One of our lovely organizers will open up a Macbook and leave it on stage, connected to the projector, during the break. It means you have 15 minutes to drop a few lines in the docs.

### How can I post a job?

Please be short, so others can add jobs in such short timeframe. Don't forget to add a link to your company or product, and your contact. The contact should be you, not an HR person, the point of this whole thing is to be able to contact people on the team where the vacancy is.

Sample:

> My company is looking for a senior iOS engineer to join the mobile development team of 25 in Budapest, at a nice US-headquartered startup called [SomeCompany, Inc.]() to work on our CMS system's iOS app called [SomeCMS]() with a current user base of 100k. You would lead the transition of our massive Objective-C/Objective-C++ codebase to a brand new Swift app.

> Hit me up at [julie@somecompany.com]() if interested, I'm Julie from the happy dev team!

### What if I'm looking for a job?

Add a few lines about yourself and what you're looking for and a contact, like:

> I'm Joe, an iOS developer with 3 years of experience with mid-sized iOS apps and some backend stuff, currently doing indie and looking for new adventures in a smaller team. Please contact me if you're a cool startup, or a hip agency, preferably in Budapest, but I'm willing to relocate inside the EU as well. My email is [joe@joesmail.com](). Here's my [LinkedIn]() and [Twitter]() profile.

### What if I've added an ad and I can't seem to find it in the uploaded version?

It got moderated then. After the first jobs board, we went through all the ads and found Android and web development related ads. We discussed it a lot with other people, who's in communities like this since years and we figured that in the privilege of the community - _you_ included - **there is no place for non-iOS/Mac development ads on the board**.

Please understand this, and don't forget what you get, when advertising iOS/Mac development jobs.
