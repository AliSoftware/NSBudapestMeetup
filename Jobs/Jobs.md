# NSBudapest Jobs board :clipboard:

----------

### How does it look like?

There's a doc, that you can edit on the spot, at our meetup. One of our lovely organizers will open up a Macbook and leave it on stage, connected to the projector, during the break. It means you have 15 minutes to drop a few lines into the board.

### How can I post a job?

Please be short, so others can add jobs in such short timeframe. Don't forget to add a link to your company or product, and your contact. The contact should be you, not an HR person, the point of this whole thing is to be able to contact people on the team where the vacancy is.

Sample:

> My company is looking for a senior iOS engineer to join the mobile development team of 25 in Budapest, at a nice US-headquartered startup called [SomeCompany, Inc.]() to work on our CMS system's iOS app called [SomeCMS]() with a current user base of 100k. You would lead the transition of our massive Objective-C/Objective-C++ codebase to a brand new Swift app.

> Hit me up at [julie@somecompany.com]() if interested, I'm Julie from the happy dev team!

### What if I'm looking for a job?

Add a few lines about yourself and what you're looking for with a contact, like:

> I'm Joe, an iOS developer with 3 years of experience with mid-sized iOS apps and some backend stuff, currently doing indie and looking for new adventures in a smaller team. Please contact me if you're a cool startup, or a hip agency, preferably in Budapest, but I'm willing to relocate inside the EU as well. My email is [joe@joesmail.com](). Here's my [LinkedIn]() and [Twitter]() profile.

### What if I've added an ad and I can't seem to find it in the uploaded version?

It got moderated then. After the first jobs board, we went through all the ads and found Android and web development related ads. We discussed it a lot with other people, who's in communities like this since years and we figured that in the privilege of the community - you included - **there is no place for non-iOS/Mac development job ads on the board**.

Remember, there are several meetups out there who might going to follow our example, as we did NSLondon's. Wouldn't it be the best if they'd hold on to the same standards too, so _you_ can make sure _you_ have the target audience when advertising?
