## Interested in talking at the meetup?

Just create an issue in this repository with describing the topic you would like to cover during your talk. Comments are welcome from everyone!

## Workshops

In April we organized our very first workshop, which was a huge success. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/NSBudapest/NSBudapestMeetup/blob/master/workshops/UITesting/UITesting.md).

## Job board

We have a monthly job board, based on the example of the [NSLondon meetup](http://www.meetup.com/NSLondon/).

**You can add iOS, or macOS dev jobs to the board, or yourself as someone looking for iOS, or macOS dev opportunities.**

*We're going to upload the board every month to this repository under the given month along with the presentations, and send the link of the board to the event on meetup.com.*

## Code of Conduct

We stand for a Welcoming Community. At our meetups we encourage respectful smart conversations that help improvement and inspire innovation. Sexism, racism, and being an asshole in general is not appreciated. If you do so, get prepared to be challenged by meetup members, who will probably ask what's wrong with you.
