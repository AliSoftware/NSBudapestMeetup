A place where you can find out how others do the technology. A place for getting to know each other. We are actually a community! :blush:

## Workshops

In April we organized our very first workshop, which was a huge success. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/NSBudapest/NSBudapestMeetup/blob/master/workshops/UITesting/UITesting.md).

## Jobs board

Since [March](https://github.com/NSBudapest/NSBudapestMeetup/blob/master/Jobs/2016/March.md), we have a jobs board every month, based on the example of the [NSLondon meetup](http://www.meetup.com/NSLondon/).

**You can add iOS, or macOS development jobs to the board, or yourself as someone looking for iOS, or macOS development related opportunities.**

*We're going to upload the board every month to this repository under the given month along with the presentations, and send the link of the board to the event on meetup.com.*

## Code of Conduct

We stand for a Welcoming Community. At our meetups we encourage respectful smart conversations that help improvement and inspire innovation. Sexism, racism, and being an asshole in general is not appreciated. If you do so, get prepared to be challenged by meetup members, who will probably ask what's wrong with you.
